# parabola-calculator
a single file (for now) parabola/quadratic equation solver that im using for my schoolwork because doing the quad is getting annoying
note that i compile with clang and use clangd language server so i dont know if it will be different with C/C++ (microsoft thing) and msvc and or mingw or gcc
